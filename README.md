# memes-selfbot-project



### READ ME: ###
# Script developed by MemeSkeleton. If you want to help with developing, debugging, etc., 
# please contact me at MemeSkeleton#3775 on Discord.
# Also developed with the assistance of Ghost Cray.

# INFO:
# For any commands that have "while True:" in the code, do not use those more than one of those commands
# at a time. It will break the bot.
# As of 5 Janurary 2021, there is no way to stop any looping commands. Simply stop the script to reset it.
# This script has only been tested on self botted accounts. It is unknown if it will work on actual bots.
# This script was deisgned for use on the online IDE Repl.it . Please contact me if you know how to get it running on other IDEs,
# or if it can run on other IDEs at all.
# If you are going to use the Repl.it IDE, and wish to have the script run 24/7 in
# the background, please contact me for instructions on how to do so.
